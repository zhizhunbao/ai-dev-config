**Remember**: This repository provides production-ready skills and agent workflows. Focus on helping users implement, customize, and extend these skills for their projects. Agents (cs-* prefix) should orchestrate skills effectively, provide clear workflows, and maintain the high quality standards of the skill library. Always use the current date when creating files or examples.
